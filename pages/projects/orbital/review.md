1. What is Remote Sensing?

   Remote sensing is the “science and art of obtaining information about an area through data acquired by a device that is not in contact with the area under investigation" (Lilles and Kiefer, 1994). Simply, remote sensing is the study of one location from another.

2. How does Remote Sensing work?

   An optical satellite sensor measures the amount of energy, as light, that comes from the Earth’s surface. The signal is then interpreted by a scientist.

3. What are the steps involved in putting a remote sensing satellite into orbit?

   The steps are Pre-launch, launch and post launch/operations.

4. How long does it take to launch a satellite, from idea to lift off?

   The pre-launch phase for many satellites takes nearly a decade. Specifications must be agreed upon, a sensor and satellite need to be designed, tested and calibrated.

5. What satellites are up there and what can they do?

* Landsat – land and coastal habitat cover, Sea-Surface Temperature (SST)
* SeaWiFS – ocean color
* MODIS – ocean color and SST
* AVHRR – SST
