The Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project: Understanding, Classifiying and Mapping Coral Reef Structures Worldwide Using High Resolution Remote Sensing Spaceborne Images.

For detailed information on the MC project see the legacy website at http://www.imars.usf.edu/MC/.

A new global coral reef database was released by the United Nations Environmental Programme World Conservation Monitoring Center (UNEP-WCMC). It represents the global distribution of tropical, sub-tropical coral reefs. It was created from multiple sources, including USF's Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project Seascape database and merged together by UNEP-WCMC and the WorldFish Centre in collaboration with WRI and TNC. It should be seen as an "interim" global product. The Approximate % coverage of data sources are as follows - Millennium Coral Reefs (Unvalidated) 50% - Millennium Coral Reefs (Validated) 30 % - Other sources 20%.

## Previous Work

The Institute for Marine Remote Sensing (IMaRS) at the University of South Florida (USF) was funded by the Oceanography Program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to provide an exhaustive worldwide inventory of coral reefs using high-resolution satellite imagery. By using a consistent dataset of high-resolution (30 meter) multispectral Landsat 7 images acquired between 1999 and 2002, USF characterized, mapped and estimated the extent of shallow coral reef ecosystems in the main coral reef provinces (Caribbean-Atlantic, Pacific, Indo-Pacific, Red Sea).

The program aimed to highlight similarities and differences between reef structures at a scale never before considered by traditional work based on field studies. It provided a reliable, spatially very well constrained data set for biogeochemical budgets, biodiversity assessment, reef structure comparisons and also provided critical information for reef managers in terms of reef location, distribution and extent, since this basic information is still of high priority for scientists and managers.
