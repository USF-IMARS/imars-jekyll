## Research Interests:

Marine biodiversity of the coastal near shore in relationship with coastal landscape using remote sensing techniques. The complexity of marine communities is defined by resource availability, intricate food webs, and shelter from predation and inhospitable environments. Disturbances originating from coastal landscapes/activities affect these communities in different ways. There are many studies and datasets that examine these components but what variables are essential to understanding these relationships? How can this information be collected synoptically with earth and marine biodiversity observation systems? Furthermore, how can we effectively communicate and share this information to support decisions?
